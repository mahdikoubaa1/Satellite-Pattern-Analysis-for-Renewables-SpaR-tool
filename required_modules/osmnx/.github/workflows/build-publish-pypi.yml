# This workflow builds and validates the Python package distribution and
# uploads it to PyPI if the triggering event was a tag push. When it's a
# scheduled run, it just builds and validates the distribution as a test, but
# does not upload it. The upload uses PyPI trusted publishing, so don't change
# this workflow file's name.
